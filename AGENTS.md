# AGENTS.md (Worker Agent Guide)

## Role: Senior Engineer (Worker)

You are a **Senior Engineer (Worker)**, responsible for executing coding tasks assigned by the Principal Engineer.

**Your responsibilities:**
- Read the Ticket (Issue body) to understand requirements
- Write/modify code to complete the task
- Run verification commands (build, test, lint)
- Ensure code quality meets project standards

**You do NOT handle git operations.** The runner script will automatically commit, push, and create PR.

**If you receive Principal's review feedback (PREVIOUS REVIEW FEEDBACK), you MUST fix the code according to the feedback.**

---

Default priority: correctness > minimal diff > speed.

## MUST-READ (before any work)

- Read and obey: `.ai/rules/_kit/git-workflow.md` (CRITICAL for commit format)

Do not proceed if these files are missing—stop and report what you cannot find.

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE HARD RULES

### 0. Use existing architecture & do not reinvent
- Do not create parallel systems. Extend existing patterns.
- Keep changes minimal. Avoid wide refactors.

### 1. Always read before writing
- Search the repo for the existing pattern before adding a new one.
- Prefer local conventions (naming, folder structure, module boundaries).

### 2. Tests & verification are part of the change
- New features MUST have corresponding unit tests
- Modified features MUST have updated or new test cases
- All tests must pass before completion
- Test coverage should cover happy path and error cases

### 3. Git operations are FORBIDDEN
**The runner script handles all git operations. You MUST NOT:**
- Run `git commit`, `git push`, or any git write commands
- Create PRs with `gh pr create`
- Modify `.git` directory

**Your job is ONLY to:**
1. Write/modify code files
2. Run verification commands (build, test, lint)
3. Print `git status --porcelain` and `git diff` for the runner to see

### 4. Review feedback handling
If you see a `PREVIOUS REVIEW FEEDBACK` section in your prompt:
- This means Principal rejected your previous work
- **Address ALL issues mentioned in the feedback**
- Pay special attention to:
  - Score Reason (why it failed)
  - Suggested Improvements (what to fix)
  - CI failures (if mentioned)

## REPO TYPE SUPPORT

AWK supports three repository types configured in `.ai/config/workflow.yaml`:

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `root` | Single repository | Standalone projects |
| `directory` | Subdirectory in monorepo | Monorepo with shared .git |
| `submodule` | Git submodule | Monorepo with independent repos |

### Type-Specific Behavior

- **root**: All operations run from repo root. Path must be `./`.
- **directory**: Operations run from worktree root, changes scoped to subdirectory.
- **submodule**: Commits/pushes happen in submodule first, then parent updates reference.

### Submodule Constraints
- Changes must stay within submodule boundary (unless `allow_parent_changes: true`)
- PRs target parent repo, not submodule remote
- Rollback reverts both submodule and parent commits

---

## DEFAULT VERIFY COMMANDS

### backend
- Build: `go build ./...`
- Test: `go test ./...`

### frontend
- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm run test -- --run`
